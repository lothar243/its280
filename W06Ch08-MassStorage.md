# Mass storage - Ch 8

## Magnetic Hard Drives

* Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

* Data is stored magnetically on several spinning disks

  * Can be damaged by vibration/shock (not a good choice for laptops)

  ![harddrive](images/harddrive.webp)

* Actuator arm moves a read/write head (this is the source of the clicking noise)

Spindle Speed

* 3600, 5400, 7200 RPM
* Faster speed generally means faster read/write
  * Require more energy
  * Creates more heat

Form Factors

* 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch

## Solid-State Drives (SSD)

Uses nonvolatile flash memory such as NAND ROM

No moving parts

Form Factors

* 2.5-inch
* mSATA
* M2 drives
* ![m2ssd](images/m2ssd.jpg)
* 
* NVME
* SATA 2.5
* Magnetic hard drives (and their RPM)
* sizes (2.5, 3.5)
* hybrid drives
* flash (ch 10)
  * sd card
  * compactflash
  * micro-sd
  * mini-sd
  * xD

SSD vs hybrid vs magnetic disk - Ch 23, p890

# Mass Storage End-of-life

Physical destruction

Recycling/repurposing

* Low-level vs standard format

* overwrite

* drive wipe
