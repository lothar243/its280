# Professionalism

1. Be on Time - plan for the traffic or taking a wrong turn
2. Present Yourself Appropriately
   * Appropriate attire
   * Hygiene
3. Be Yourself
4. A Warm Smile - A smile and good attitude help put people at ease
5. Be Open and Confident
   * Stand tall
   * Smile
   * Make Eye Contact
   * Firm handshake
   * Be aware of nervous habits, and practice relaxation techniques, if necessary
6. Use Small Talk - Take a few minutes to learn something about them
7. Be Positive
8. Be Courteous and Attentive

## Traits

### Honesty and Integrity

* Honesty - Telling the truth
* Integrity - Doing the right thing

Avoid Learning a user's password - have them assign a temporary password when necessary, or create temporary accounts

Follow the Golden Rule (Do unto other as you would have done unto you)

* Treat other people's data and devices with care

### Dependability and Responsibility

Be on time - "Five minutes early is on time, and on time is late"

If late, contact the customer immediately

Don't waste their time

### Sensitivity

Appreciate another's feelings and emotions

Customers have potentially lost information and or devices, and they may be upset

Be culturally sensitive

## Effective Communication

### Assertive Communication

Use statements such as “I know how frustrating it feels to lose data,” or “I understand how infuriating it is when the network goes out and you can’t get your job done.” Statements like these cool off the situation and let customers know you are on their side. Avoid using the word “you,” as it can sound accusatory.

The second part of assertive communication is making sure you state the problem clearly without accusing the user directly.

### Respectful Communication

Respect that the customer's job is important

Actively listen when a customer is talking - take notes and request clarification where necessary

Avoid distractions - Don't start texting coworkers while interacting with the customer

Avoid social media while on the job

### Getting Answers

Never accuse

Talk to the customer with the goal of getting answers that will help you troubleshoot

* When did it last work?
* Has it ever worked this way?
* Has any new hardware been added?

Keep your questions friendly and factual

Cell Phone Use

1. Put your phone away
2. Turn off your ringer
3. Use Your Cell Phone for Important Calls Only
4. Let Voicemail Pick Up Your Calls
5. Find a private place to make cell phone calls
6. Don't be on a call in the restroom
7. Don't look at your phone during meetings (or class) unless it is for something related to the meeting

# Safety

## Personal Safety

Keep a tidy work area (trip hazards)

Be aware of electrical shock

* wall power
* power supplies
* capacitors

Lifting Injuries - Heavy equipment

Repetitive Stress Injuries

* Posture
* Carpal Tunnel

## Electrostatic discharge (ESD)

Sudden flow of electricity (static shock) can damage fragile components
To avoid static discharge, be at the same electric potential - we call this being grounded

### Antistatic Tools

* ESD Straps - Use an ESD strap attached to what you are working on - Don't plug it into an electrical ground
* ESD mat - Another method of connecting to the workpiece
 * Antistatic bags - bag designed to shed static charge while in storage
 * Self-grounding - touching the chassis of a computer before touching internal components - not continual, but better than nothing

## Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

Changing electric or magnetic fields propagate through space (this is what EM waves are)

These EM waves can cause current, think of antennas

If this current is unwanted, or causes problems, it is interference

## Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)

If the interference is in the radio frequency (20kHz to 300GHz), we call it radio frequency interference

Many devices emit RFI, but microwaves are the most noticeable in my opinion

# Physical Tools

A screwdriver - number 2 Phillips (I like the type that can take several different driver bits)

ESD strap

Basic tech toolkit

* Screwdriver
* Variety of driver bits
* Hemostat, tweezers, or small magnet for grabbing dropped parts

More specialized toolkits (eg for mobile devices)

* Spudgers (prying tools)
* Suction cups

USB Drives - Various Diagnosis Tools and OS install disks

Multimeter for checking electrical circuits (maybe)

# Troubleshooting Methodology

1. Identify the problem - ask about recent changes, review logs
2. Establish a theory - If necessary conduct research based on symptoms
3. Test the theory to determine cause
   * If it is confirmed, determine the next step to resolve the problem
   * If it is not confirmed, re-establish new theory or escalate
4. Establish a plan of action and implement the solution
5. Verify full system functionality
6. Document findings, actions, and outcomes

When trying to determine a problem, investigate the simple things first. Be sure not to over-complicate things (Network suddenly doesn't work? Did something get unplugged?)

It can be a challenge to test a theory, because the test and the fix may be the same. Can you easily revert the change if it doesn't fix anything?

A plan of action may involve more than just fixing the problem - should you create a full backup first?
