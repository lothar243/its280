# Display Technologies

## LCD Monitors - Liquid crystal display

### How LCDs work

* Backlight
* Polarizing Filter
* Polarizing agent & Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) matrix, or active matrix
* A translucent sheet give the ability to have RGB subpixels, even though it starts out white
* 2nd Polarizing filter 90 degrees to the first

### LCD Components

* LCD panel
* Backlight
* Inverter (in older models)

### LCD Panel Technologies

* Twisted nematics (TN) - most common
  * Cheapest
  * High refresh rates
  * Poor color reproduction
  * Most restricted viewing angle
* In-plane switching (IPS) - 2nd most common
  * Best color
  * Widest viewing angle
  * Most expensive
* Vertical alignment (VA)
  * Better response than IPS, but better color than TN

## LCD Variations

### Backlights

* Light-emitting diode (LED)
  * Uses DC
  * Edge LED backlighting - edges may be brighter than the middle
  * Direct LED backlighting - better uniformity of brightness
* Previous generations used CCFL - (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp)
  * Requires an inverter because they need high frequency AC
  * Noticeably thicker than LED styles

### Resolution

* Designed to run at a single **native resolution**
  * At lower resolutions, uses interpolation to soften the jagged corners of pixes that don't line up perfectly
* The number of pixels arranged on the screen define the aspect ratio of the picture, such as 16:9 or 21:9

### Brightness

* Measured in nits
  * Varies from 100 nits to 1000 or more nits. On average around 300 nits

### Other considerations

* Viewing Angle
* Response Rate - amount of time for all sub-pixels to change from one state to another
* Refresh Rate - How often the screen change change or update completely
* Contrast Ratio - The difference between the darkest and lightest spots
* Color Depth - The amount of colors the panel can display
